    #very very very Important Note :
    #to override password reset and change user registration in general 
    #1. Add templates dirctory to the 'DIRS' dict in Settings (aadd full path using BASE_DIR)   
    #2. for password change add two templates (password_change_form) and (password_change_done)
    
    #3. for Password reset we have to do the follwing :
    # A)add 5 Templates 
          #password_reset_form.html -> to enter email
          #password_reset_done.html -> to prompt email sent 
          #password_reset_email.html -> email templates : must contain {{protocole}}://{{domain}}{%url 'password_reset_confirm'  uidb64=uid token=token%}
          
          #uidb64 : arguments generated by django to authenticate the request when user clicks the link in the email 
          #this argument is sent with the link to the user email with the token 
          
          #token is a randomly generated string by django also to confirm user request from email 
          #token is sent with the link on email
          
          
          #password_reset_confirm.html -> form to enter new password after coming from email link
          #password_reset_complete.html ->prompt reset successfull 
          
    #B) we must  add the following to urls.py if we want to overrid the built in functionality 
        #note the uidb64 and token in the url is a must (they are filled by django)
          
    path('accounts/reset/<uidb64>/<token>/', auth_views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(), name='password_reset_confirm'),
    
  #c) we can override the PasswordResetConfirm view  by creating a class based view in views.py and 
      #pass the email template that we want
